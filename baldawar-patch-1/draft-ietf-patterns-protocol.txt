1.  Introduction

   Event matching libraries are software components that enable
   developers to perform advanced querying and filtering operations on
   data structures in real-time.  These libraries provide powerful
   mechanisms to then search, extract, and manipulate specific
   information within complex data objects.  They are commonly used in a
   variety of domains, including data processing, event-driven systems,
   and data integration.

1.1.  Current State

   At present [Quamina] and [Ruler] are two known examples that are
   optimized for fast processing.  While both has similar origins, they
   were built independently and have gaps in features supported.
   Quamina exclusively supports shell-style matching while Event-Ruler
   does the same for CIDR and Numeric matching.  Event Ruler also has
   reserved keywords (https://github.com/aws/event-
   ruler/blob/main/src/main/software/amazon/event/ruler/Constants.java)
   for future matchers against regular-expressions, dates, and strings
   isn't the case for Quamina.

1.2.  Need for Standardization

   While more work is necessary to identify additional libraries with
   similar intent, the current landsacpe is expected to be a fragmented
   across different libraries and langauges.  With no guide for
   standardization, each library organically introduced its own syntax
   and semantics for specifying field queries, leading to
   inconsistencies and limited interoperability between libraries.

   This poses several challenges.  Developers often need to learn and
   adapt to different query languages when switching between libraries,
   increasing development effort and creating a barrier to entry.
   Furthermore, the lack of interoperability hampers collaboration and
   limits the reusability of code across different matching libraries
   such as common test and benchmarking framework.

   To address these challenges, there is a clear need for a standardized
   query language for field querying in matching libraries.

1.3.  Scope

   The document's primary goal is to define a common syntax and
   semantics for patterns used in matching libraries.  By establishing a
   shared understanding of how fields are queried, developers can write
   portable and reusable code across different libraries.  Additionally,
   this standardization aims to foster collaboration, simplify
   integration, and enhance the overall ecosystem of matching libraries.

   This document focuses on patterns used for querying fields within
   data objects, with an emphasis on JSON as described in [RFC8259].
   While other querying mechanisms (such as regular expressions and SQL)
   and formats (such as Avro and Ion) exists, this standardization
   effort specifically addresses patterns expressed in JSON syntax and
   leaves others for future revisions.

1.4.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terminology used in this document follows the definitions
   specified in [RFC8259] for JSON constructs.  Additionally, specific
   terms introduced within the context of patterns and matching
   libraries will be defined as they arise.

   Throughout the document, examples will be provided to illustrate
   pattern syntax and usage.  These examples are not normative and serve
   only to aid comprehension.

1.5.  Document Structure

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows: Section 2
   provides background information on matching libraries and the need
   for standardization.  Section 3 introduces the concept of patterns
   and their role in matching libraries.  Sections 4 to 9 discuss
   various aspects of patterns, including extended patterns,
   standardization approach, implementation guidelines, and security
   considerations.  Finally, the document concludes with
   acknowledgments, references, and any relevant appendices.

2.  Patterns

   A pattern in the context of matching libraries is a query expression
   used to identify and match specific fields within data objects.  A
   field represents a specific value within a data object, identified by
   its path from the root of the object.  Patterns provides a concise
   and expressive way to specify the desired criteria for field
   matching.  Patterns MAY be applied to various types of data
   structures, but this document primarily focuses on JSON-based
   patterns.

2.1.  Syntax and Semantics

   Patterns are expressed as JSON objects, conforming to the syntax
   defined in [RFC8259].  The syntax allows for the composition of
   complex patterns by combining objects, arrays, strings, numbers, and
   boolean values.  Leaf values in a pattern must be enclosed within
   arrays.

   The semantics of patterns dictate how they are evaluated and matched
   against fields in data objects.  A pattern must contain an exact path
   specification, represented as a list of strings, leading to a leaf
   value in the target object.  The leaf value MAY be either a direct
   match or an extended pattern, which further refines the matching
   criteria.

2.2.  Field Matching and Path Specification

   Field matching involves comparing the values of fields in data
   objects with the patterns defined.  Each field consists of a leaf
   value and a path, which is a sequence of strings representing the
   hierarchy of field names leading to the leaf value from the root of
   the object.

   Path specifications in patterns omit arrays, focusing solely on the
   field names.  By matching the path and comparing the leaf value of a
   field, patterns determine whether a field in a data object satisfies
   the specified criteria.

   Consider the following pattern:

   {"alpha": {"beta": [ 1 ]}}

   In this pattern, "alpha" is the field name, "beta" is the subfield
   name that defines the path as "alpha.beta", and [1] is the leaf
   value.  This pattern would match an event object with the field
   structure:

   {"alpha": {"beta": 1}}

   It would also match a pattern where event object was wrapped within
   an array structure:

   {"alpha":  [ {"beta": 1} , {"beta": 2}, {"gamma": false} ]}

   Patterns MAY also directly specify the path that needs to be
   travelled for simplicity as shown in the following pattern:

   {"alpha.beta": [ 1 ]}

3.  Extended Patterns

   This section describes several types of extended patterns commonly
   supported by matching libraries, including prefix, suffix, exists,
   anything-but, CIDR, and wildcard patterns.  Extended patterns expand
   the capabilities of basic patterns by introducing additional types of
   matching criteria.  These criteria allow for more flexible and
   expressive field querying within data objects.  Extended patterns are
   represented as JSON objects with a designated field called the
   "Pattern Type" that specifies the type of extended pattern being
   used.  Each pattern type has its own syntax and semantics for
   specifying matching conditions.

   Libraries MAY implement additional extendend patterns such as "shell-
   style" that are outside of the current spe but could be included in
   future revisions.

3.1.  Prefix Pattern

   The prefix pattern allows developers to match fields based on a
   prefix string.  It is useful when partial matching or searching for
   fields with a common prefix is desired.  The pattern type for the
   prefix pattern is "prefix" and its value is a string representing the
   desired prefix.

   Example:

   Consider the following event:

   {"name": "John Doe"}

   A prefix pattern to match the "name" field with a prefix of "John"
   would be:

   {"name": {"prefix": "John"}}

   This pattern would successfully match the event because the field
   value "John Doe" has a prefix of "John."

3.2.  Suffix Pattern

   The suffix pattern matches fields whose values have a specific
   suffix.  The "Pattern Type" for a suffix pattern is set to "suffix",
   and its value is a string representing the desired suffix.

   Example: Consider the following event:

   {"email": "johndoe@example.com"}

   To match fields where the value ends with "@example.com", the suffix
   pattern would be:

   {"email": {"suffix": "@example.com"}}

   This pattern would match the example event, as the field "email" has
   a value that ends with the suffix "@example.com".

3.3.  Wildcard Pattern

   The wildcard pattern matches fields using wildcard characters for
   partial matches.  The "Pattern Type" for a wildcard pattern is set to
   "wildcard", and its value is a string containing wildcard characters.
   Wildcard characters MAY stand in for any number of characters
   inluding zero characters.

   Example: Consider the following event:

   {"file": "document.txt"}

   To match fields where the value matches the wildcard pattern
   "docent", the wildcard pattern would be:

   {"file": {"wildcard": "doc*ent*"}}

   This pattern would match the example event, as the field "file"
   matches the wildcard pattern.

   To match the asterisk character specifically, a wildcard character
   SHOULD be escaped with a backslash.  Two consecutive backslashes,
   that is a backslash escaped with a backslash, represents the actual
   backslash character.  A backslash escaping any character other than
   asterisk or backslash is not allowed.

3.4.  Exists Pattern

   The exists pattern matches fields based on their existence or non-
   existence.  The "Pattern Type" for an exists pattern is set to
   "exists", and its value is a boolean indicating whether the field
   should exist or not.

   Example: Consider the following event:

   {"name": "John Doe"}

   To match fields where the field "name" exists, the exists pattern
   would be:

   {"name": {"exists": true}}

   This pattern would match the example event, as the field "name"
   exists.  Conversely, to match fields where the field "age" does not
   exist, the exists pattern would be:

   {"age": {"exists": false}}

   This pattern would also match the example event, as the field "age"
   does not exist.

3.5.  CIDR Matching

   The CIDR matching allows for matching IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges.
   The "Pattern Type" for an exists pattern is set to "cidr", and its
   value is a CIDR notation as described within [RFC4632].

   Example: Consider the following event:

   {"ip": "192.0.2.1"}

   To match fields where the value is within the CIDR range
   "192.0.2.0/24", the CIDR pattern would be:

   {"ip": {"cidr": "192.0.2.0/24"}}

   This pattern would match the example event, as the field "ip" falls
   within the specified CIDR range.

3.6.  Numeric Matching

   Numeric matching patterns allow for specifying conditions based on
   JSON number values.  Numeric matching is works for values between
   -5.0e9 and +5.0e9 inclusive, with 15 digits of precision or six
   digits to the right of the decimal point.  Numeric values outside
   this range MAY not be supported for matching.

   The following example demonstrates numeric matching for an event
   pattern that matches events based on numeric conditions for multiple
   fields:

   {
     "detail": {
       "c-count": [ { "numeric": [ ">", 0, "<=", 5 ] } ],
       "d-count": [ { "numeric": [ "<", 10 ] } ],
       "x-limit": [ { "numeric": [ "=", 3.018e2 ] } ]
     }
   }

   In this pattern, the following conditions are specified for the
   respective fields:

   *  The "detail.c-count" field should have a numeric value greater
      than 0 and less than or equal to 5.

   *  The "detail.d-count" field should have a numeric value less than
      10.

   *  The "detail.x-limit" field should have a numeric value equal to
      3.018e2.

   It will match following event

   {
     "detail": {
       "c-count": 3,
       "d-count": 5,
       "x-limit": 301.8
     }
   }

4.  Complex Matching Patterns

   This section describes examples of complex matching patterns and
   their usage.  Complex matching patterns allow for creation more
   sophisticated event patterns.  They MAY allow for multiple rules to
   be combined for logical operations.  They also support nesting for
   matching against a complex but singular criteria for a part of an
   event.  These patterns provide increased flexibility and granularity
   in specifying the conditions under which an event should be matched.

4.1.  And Matching

   When multiple multiple patterns are specified together, this
   effectively acts as logical and operator.  This mean the aggregate
   complex pattern will only be a match if all rules within the pattern
   match.

   Consider the following example rule:

   {
     "time": [ { "prefix": "2017-10-02" } ],
     "detail": {
       "state": [ { "anything-but": "initializing" } ],
       "c-count": [ { "numeric": [ ">", 0, "<=", 5 ] } ],
       "d-count": [ { "numeric": [ "<", 10 ] } ],
       "x-limit": [ { "anything-but": [ 100, 200, 300 ] } ]
     }
   }

   This pattern specifies the following matching rules for different
   fields:

   *  The "time" field should have a prefix of "2017-10-02".

   *  The "detail.state" field should not match the value
      "initializing".

   *  The "detail.c-count" field should have a numeric value greater
      than 0 and less than or equal to 5.

   *  The "detail.d-count" field should have a numeric value less than
      10.

   *  The "detail.x-limit" field should not match the values 100, 200,
      or 300.

   It will match following event as it matches all rules:

   {
     "time": "2017-10-02T00:00:00Z" ,
     "detail": {
       "state": "terminating",
       "c-count": 5,
       "d-count": 5,
       "x-limit": 400
     }
   }

   And fail to match following event as it failed to match the last rule
   :

   {
     "time": "2017-10-02T00:00:00Z" ,
     "detail": {
       "state": "terminating",
       "c-count": 5,
       "d-count": 5,
       "x-limit": 200
     }
   }

   Note, as is the case specified [RFC8259], the behavior of pattern
   matching is unpredictable when the fields within a rule are not
   unique.  [Ruler] implementations only respect the last name/value
   pair only but [Quamina] reports an error.

4.2.  Or Matching

   Complex event patterns MAY also be used to match any of the values
   across multiple fields using the "$or" construct.  This allows for
   more flexible matching conditions based on various field values.

   The following example demonstrates an event pattern that matches if
   any of the specified conditions are met:

   {
     "detail": {
       "$or": [
         { "c-count": [ { "numeric": [ ">", 0, "<=", 5 ] } ] },
         { "d-count": [ { "numeric": [ "<", 10 ] } ] },
         { "x-limit": [ { "numeric": [ "=", 3.018e2 ] } ] }
       ]
     }
   }

   In this pattern, the "$or" construct is used to check if any of the
   following conditions are met:

   *  The "c-count" field has a numeric value greater than 0 and less
      than or equal to 5.

   *  The "d-count" field has a numeric value less than 10.

   *  The "x-limit" field has a numeric value equal to 3.018e2.

   Complex matching patterns with the "$or" construct provide a powerful
   way to create flexible matching conditions across multiple fields.

   Consider following example rule:

   {
     "source": [ "aws.cloudwatch" ],
     "$or": [
       { "metricName": [ "CPUUtilization", "ReadLatency" ] },
       { "namespace": [ "AWS/EC2", "AWS/ES" ] }
     ]
   }

   It will match following event:

   {
     "source": "aws.cloudwatch" ,
     "metricName": "CPUUtilization"
   }

   and following event :

   {
     "source": "aws.cloudwatch" ,
     "metricName": "CPUUtilization"
   }

4.3.  Matching Anything But

   The anything-but matching pattern allows for excluding specific
   values or patterns from matching.  You MAY consider it logical NOT
   operator applied to single string or numeric values, lists of values,
   as a prefix, or suffix match.

   The following examples illustrate different usages of the anything-
   but matching rule:

 {
   "detail": {
     // anything-but (string)
     "state": [{ "anything-but": "initializing" }],
     // anything-but (number)
     "x-limit": [{ "anything-but": 123 }],
     // Anything-but list (strings)
     "status": [{ "anything-but": [ "stopped", "overloaded" ]}],
     // Anything-but list (numbers)
     "y-limit": [{ "anything-but": [ 100, 200, 300 ]}],
     // Anything-but prefix
     "x-reason": [{ "anything-but": { "prefix": "init" }}],
     // Anything-but suffix
     "y-reason": [{ "anything-but": { "suffix": "1234" }}],
     // Anything-but-ignore-case list (strings)
     "error-code": [{ "anything-but": {"equals-ignore-case": "RETRY" }}]
   }
 }

4.4.  Nesting

   Complex matching patterns MAY be combined to further allowing for
   fine-grained control over event filtering and processing.  This is
   illustrated by following example that in effect implements the logic
   shown as the top-level comment within the example.

// Effect of ("source" && ("metricName" || ("metricType && "namespace" && ("metricId" || "spaceId")) || "scope") || ( "status" != "initializing" )))
{
  "source": [ "aws.cloudwatch" ],
  "$or": [
    { "metricName": [ "CPUUtilization", "ReadLatency" ] },
    {
      "metricType": [ "MetricType" ] ,
      "namespace": [ "AWS/EC2", "AWS/ES" ],
      "$or" : [
        { "metricId": [ 1234 ] },
        { "spaceId": [ 1000 ] }
      ]
    },
    { "scope": [ "Service" ] },
    {
        { "status": [ { "anything-but": "initializing" } ] }
    }
  ]
}

5.  Examples

   To better understand the practical application of standardized
   patterns, the following examples demonstrate their usage in different
   scenarios, showcasing various matchers:

5.1.  Field Matching and Path Specification

   Consider the following pattern:

   {
     "field1": "value1",
     "field2": { "prefix": "abc" },
     "field3": { "suffix": "xyz" },
     "field4": { "exists": true },
     "field5": { "anything-but": "value2" },
     "field6": { "equals-ignore-case": "Value3" }
   }

   This pattern matches data objects where:

   *  "field1" exactly matches "value1".

   *  "field2" starts with the prefix "abc".

   *  "field3" ends with the suffix "xyz".

   *  "field4" exists in the data object.

   *  "field5" does not match the value "value2".

   *  "field6" matches the value "Value3" regardless of case
      sensitivity.

5.2.  Numeric Matching and CIDR Matching

   The pattern below showcases numeric and CIDR matching:

   {
     "field1": { "numeric": [ ">", 10, "<=", 20 ] },
     "field2": { "cidr": "192.168.0.0/16" }
   }

   This pattern matches data objects where:

   *  "field1" is a numeric value greater than 10 and less than or equal
      to 20.

   *  "field2" is an IP address that falls within the CIDR block
      "192.168.0.0/16".

5.3.  Complex Matching with Anything-But and $or

   The pattern below demonstrates complex matching using the anything-
   but and $or matchers:

   {
     "$or": [
       { "field1": "value1" },
       { "field2": { "anything-but": [ "value2", "value3" ] } },
       { "field3": { "exists": true } }
     ]
   }

   This pattern matches data objects where:

   *  Either "field1" exactly matches "value1" OR

   *  "field2" does not match the values "value2" or "value3" OR

   *  "field3" exists in the data object.

   These examples showcase the versatility of standardized patterns and
   the ability to express complex matching requirements using a
   combination of matchers.  Developers MAY leverage these patterns to
   effectively query and filter data objects based on various criteria.

6.  7 Use Cases

   1.  *Filtering*: Organizations can use patterns to filter and process
       events based on specific criteria.  For example, an event
       processing system can match events that contain a specific
       keyword in the event description or events generated by a
       particular source.  Log management systems can employ patterns to
       extract relevant lines from log files.

   2.  *Stream Routing*: Patterns can be used to route relevant streams
       of information to domain specific subsystems.  For example, an
       eventbus can be receive all events for an e-commerce platform and
       then route to domain specific events to microservices that serve
       payment, shipping, and ordering.  Also, By defining patterns that
       match specific sensor readings or patterns of sensor events,
       organizations can derive insights and trigger actions based on
       IoT data.

   3.  *Data Validation*: Patterns facilitate data validation by
       allowing organizations to define rules for validating incoming
       data.  For instance, an e-commerce platform can define patterns
       to ensure that user-provided information, such as dates being
       within valid ranges.  IT systems can verify ip-address being
       valid range.

   4.  *Fraud and Anomaly Detection*: Organizations can leverage
       patterns to detect suspicious activities and potential fraud.  By
       combining multiple matchers, such as numeric ranges, exclusion
       rules, and existence checks, systems can identify abnormal
       patterns of transactions or behavior.  Patterns that match known
       attack signatures, anomalous network behavior, or malicious file
       patterns, organizations can enhance their security posture.

   5.  *Monitoring*: Patterns can be used to create sophisticated
       monitoring systems that track and analyze data streams in real-
       time.  Multiple streams can be monitored for governance,
       compliance, auditing, resource monitoring.

   6.  *Geolocation-based Matching:* Applications that rely on
       geolocation data can utilize patterns to match data based on
       specific geographic regions.  This can be useful for regional
       content delivery, or compliance with local regulations.

   These use cases highlight the broad applicability of standardized
   patterns in diverse domains, providing a flexible and powerful
   toolset for data querying, filtering, and analysis.

7.  Security Considerations

   Generally, there are security issues when parsing text.  When
   designing and implementing systems that utilize pattern matching,
   validate and sanitize input patterns to prevent injection attacks or
   unintended consequences.

   Patterns with complex or inefficient matching rules can potentially
   lead to resource exhaustion or performance degradation, and
   implementers should consider limiting the complexity of patterns (suc
   as length/depth of inputs) or enforcing timeouts to mitigate the risk
   of denial-of-service attacks.

   When implementing patterns for matching extended patterns that
   necessisate references, any security considerations listed within
   those document MUST be accounted for.
